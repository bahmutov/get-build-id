# get-build-id

> GitHub action to fetch the build ID from Next.js deployment

## Outputs

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for the current outputs

- `buildId` The string build id
- `branch` The source branch extracted from the build id, if any
- `commit` The commit SHA extracted from the build id, if any

You can access the above outputs using `${{ steps.<step name>.outputs.<output name> }}` expression syntax, see the [ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow.

## Use

In your `next.config.js` return the build ID formed from the `branch:::commit SHA` strings, for example like [this](https://github.com/bahmutov/next-ts-app/blob/main/next.config.js)

```js
// next.config.js
// https://github.com/cypress-io/commit-info
const { getBranch, getSha } = require('@cypress/commit-info')

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  generateBuildId: async () => {
    // make sure to use Vercel variables if available
    // https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables
    const branch =
      process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF ||
      (await getBranch()) ||
      'unknown branch'
    const sha =
      process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA || (await getSha()) || 'unknown sha'
    const buildId = `${branch}:::${sha}`
    console.log('generated build id "%s"', buildId)
    return buildId
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

The build ID embedded in the application will usually be something like "main:::<sha>". This build ID is embedded in every HTML page, and you can get to it using this action. In your workflow use:

```yml
- name: Get the build info ðŸ–¨
  uses: bahmutov/get-build-id@v1
  id: get-build-id
  with:
    # USE YOUR DEPLOYED URL
    url: 'https://next-ts-app-swart.vercel.app/'

- name: Print the build outputs ðŸ–¨
  run: |
    echo "Next.js build ID: ${{ steps.get-build-id.outputs.buildId }}"
    echo "Next.js build branch: ${{ steps.get-build-id.outputs.branch }}"
    echo "Next.js build commit: ${{ steps.get-build-id.outputs.commit }}"
```
